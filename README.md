# Note Taker

An app that can be used to write and save notes.

## Reason for Creation

I hate writing on paper and needed a better way to keep notes other than using notepad.

## How to use
- clone the repo
- install dependencies (run 'npm i' in terminal)
- in terminal run "node server.js"
- open preffered internet browser
- go to localhost:(3001) or if Heroku is up (enter URL here)
- Landing page will have a button for "notes"
- Clicking on the button will bring you to the notes page which will have all saved notes in it.
